# Rectus
Troll virus written in Python. Displays rectangles all over the screen

# How does it work?
Rectus uses [pywin32](https://pypi.org/project/pywin32/) and the Rectangle function to display randomly generated rectangles.

# Is it safe?
So Yes and no You can edit a stopcode that activates whenever a specific buuton is pressed. But it does not harm your devive.

If everything goes wrong just restart your PC.

Edit stopcode here:
